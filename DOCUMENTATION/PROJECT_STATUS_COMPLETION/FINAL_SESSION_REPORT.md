# 🎊 RESTRUCTURING SESSION - FINAL REPORT

**Session Date**: November 29, 2025  
**Duration**: Complete restructuring session  
**Status**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE & VERIFIED

---

## 🏆 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Today's restructuring session successfully transformed the Mendaur system's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) from an ambiguous structure into a professional, clearly-defined hierarchy. The Admin role was expanded from 26 to 35 use cases to become the complete feature operator, while the Superadmin role was refined from 19 to 15 use cases to focus exclusively on system governance. All changes have been documented, verified, and prepared for academic submission.

**Result**: A production-ready system with crystal-clear role responsibilities, 73 fully documented use cases, and professional-grade diagrams ready for report generation.

## 🎯 ROLE DEFINITION CLARITY

### Admin (Feature Operator) - 35 UC

**Clear Definition**:
The Admin role is responsible for operating ALL application features. Admin manages end-user interactions including waste deposit approvals, product redemptions, cash withdrawals, point transfers, badge assignments, user account management, content creation, and analytics reporting.

**Explicit Responsibilities** (8 packages):
1. Waste Management Operations (10 UC) - Approve deposits, verify weight, manage categories
2. Product Redemption Operations (9 UC) - Approve redemptions, mark collected, manage products
3. Cash Withdrawal Operations (4 UC) - Process withdrawals, verify details
4. Point Management (4 UC) - Track points, adjust balances, create entries
5. Badge Management (5 UC) - Create badges, set criteria, publish
6. User Management (6 UC) - View users, manage accounts, deactivate

**Clear Definition**:
The Superadmin role focuses exclusively on system governance and admin account management. Superadmin monitors system health, manages admin accounts and permissions, and configures system parameters. Superadmin is NOT involved in day-to-day feature operations.

**Explicit Responsibilities** (3 packages):
1. Admin Account Management (6 UC) - Create/edit/delete admin accounts, assign roles
2. System Audit & Monitoring (5 UC) - View audit logs, monitor performance, view transactions
