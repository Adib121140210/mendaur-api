## 📊 Cleanup Recommendation

### ✅ SAFE TO DELETE (No Risk)
```
✓ adminApi_FIXED.js
✓ award_test_badges.php
✓ check_user_badges.php
✓ check_user3_badges.php
✓ sync_user3_badges.php
✓ DashboardController.php.backup
```

**Reason:** All temporary test/debug scripts. Production code doesn't depend on them.

### ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Keep as Documentation Reference)
```
⚠ BADGE_*.md files (Multiple)
⚠ FIX_APPLIED_*.md
⚠ FRONTEND_*.js
⚠ IMPLEMENTATION_TEST_REPORT.php
```

**Reason:** Good for reference/history, but not needed for production.
